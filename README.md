## ü§ñ Agent Architecture

### Core Agents

1. **Bill Parser**
   - Extracts and structures legislative documents
   - Identifies key components (definitions, sections, penalties)

2. **Debate Agents**
   - Ruling Party Agent: Advocates for the policy
   - Opposition Party Agent: Critically analyzes potential issues
   - Debate Moderator: Ensures fair and structured discussion

3. **Judicial Panel**
   - Multiple Judge Agents evaluate the policy
   - Considers legal, ethical, and social implications
   - Provides final verdict and recommendations

4. **Amendment Writer**
   - Suggests specific changes to improve the policy
   - Provides alternative wordings and additional clauses

## üìö Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the policy analysis system
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Set up your agents
bill_parser = AssistantAgent(
    name="bill_parser_agent",
    system_message="""
    You are BillParserAgent, a legislative document parser within the PolicyForgeAI system.
    Your role is to analyze and structure policy documents.
    """
